## Introduction

**GitChain** is a visionary project aimed at creating a fully decentralized alternative to GitHub. Our goal is to empower developers and organizations with a platform that is not mediated by any corporation and is wholly independent of centralized cloud servers. By leveraging advanced cryptographic technologies and peer-to-peer networking, GitChain seeks to redefine how we collaborate on code, making it more secure, accessible, and community-driven.

---

## Vision

In a world increasingly reliant on software, the platforms we use to build and share code should reflect the values of openness, security, and decentralization. GitChain aspires to:

- **Eliminate Central Points of Failure:** Remove dependency on centralized servers that can be censored, hacked, or suffer downtime.
- **Empower Users:** Provide full control over code repositories, contributions, and collaboration without corporate gatekeepers.
- **Enhance Security and Trust:** Utilize cutting-edge cryptographic methods to ensure integrity, authenticity, and privacy.
- **Foster Community Ownership:** Enable the global community to maintain and evolve the platform collectively.

---

## Key Features

- **Fully Decentralized Architecture:** No central servers; every user contributes to the network.
- **Peer-to-Peer Networking:** Direct communication between nodes for repository sharing and updates.
- **Cryptographic Identity Management:** Users are identified and authenticated through cryptographic keys.
- **Secure Code Collaboration:** All contributions are signed and verified, ensuring code integrity.
- **Integration with Git:** Seamless use of familiar Git commands and workflows.
- **Advanced Cryptography:** Implementation of triple-entry bookkeeping, zero-knowledge proofs, and fully homomorphic encryption.

## Why GitChain?

### Better Than GitHub

GitChain aims to surpass GitHub by offering:

- **Enhanced Security:** All code commits are cryptographically signed and verified.
- **User Autonomy:** No corporate intermediaries controlling access or policies.
- **Resilience:** Decentralization reduces the risk of outages or data loss.
- **Transparent Governance:** Community-driven development and decision-making.

### Cheaper and More Accessible

- **Cost Efficiency:** Users only need to run a local node, incurring minimal costs (electricity and hardware they're already using).
- **No Subscription Fees:** Eliminates the need for paid plans to access advanced features.
- **Inclusivity:** Accessible to anyone with a computer and internet connection.

### Safer and More Secure

- **Data Integrity:** Distributed storage ensures that code cannot be tampered with unnoticed.
- **Privacy:** Advanced encryption techniques protect sensitive information.
- **Trustless Environment:** Security is maintained through cryptographic proofs rather than trust in a third party.

### Faster and More Efficient

- **Optimized Networking:** Peer-to-peer connections can reduce latency for repository operations.
- **Scalability:** The network grows organically with each new node, enhancing performance.
- **Local Caching:** Frequently accessed repositories are stored locally, speeding up access.

## How It Works

### Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Network

At the core of GitChain is a decentralized network where each user's computer acts as a node. When you run the GitChain node software, your machine connects to other peers, forming a robust mesh network. This architecture eliminates the need for central servers, much like how torrents distribute files across multiple users.

**Example Metaphor:** Think of GitChain as a community bulletin board where everyone in the neighborhood can post messages and read others'. There's no central authority managing it; instead, everyone contributes to maintaining it.

### Cryptographic Identity and Ownership

Every user generates a unique cryptographic key pair (a public and private key). These keys serve as your digital identity on the network.

- **Public Key:** Your identity visible to others.
- **Private Key:** Secret key used to sign your actions (like commits).

**Ownership and Permissions:**

- The creator of a repository is recognized by their public key.
- Permissions (like who can merge code) are defined in the repository's metadata and enforced by the network.

### Repository Distribution and Consensus

Repositories are distributed across the network nodes:

- **Cloning a Repository:** When you clone a repo, you become a part of its distribution network.
- **Updating Repositories:** Pulling changes fetches the latest version that the network has reached consensus on.
- **Achieving Consensus:** Nodes agree on the repository's state by verifying cryptographic signatures and adherence to permission rules.

**Data Integrity:**

- Commits are immutable and linked together via cryptographic hashes (much like blocks in a blockchain).
- Any alteration in the history is immediately detectable by other nodes.

### Integration with Git

GitChain integrates seamlessly with Git, allowing you to use familiar commands:

- **Cloning:** `git clone gitchain://repository_name`
- **Committing:** `git commit -m "Your message"`
- **Pushing:** `git push`
- **Pulling:** `git pull`

**Custom Git Remote Helper:**

- A Git remote helper bridges Git commands with the GitChain network.
- It intercepts commands that interact with remote repositories and routes them through your local GitChain node.

## Advanced Technologies

GitChain isn't just about decentralization; it's also a platform to showcase and implement advanced cryptographic techniques that enhance security and trust.

### Triple-Entry Bookkeeping

**Concept Overview:**

- Traditional double-entry bookkeeping records each transaction twice (debit and credit).
- **Triple-entry bookkeeping** adds a third component: a cryptographic receipt that is shared among all parties involved.

**Application in GitChain:**

- Each code commit is a transaction between the developer, the repository, and the network.
- A cryptographic proof (the third entry) ensures that the commit is authentic and hasn't been tampered with.
- Enhances transparency and trust in the codebase's history.

**Metaphor:** Imagine a transaction where you, your friend, and a secure vault all have matching records of an agreement. Any discrepancy would immediately be evident, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)

**Concept Overview:**

- ZKPs allow one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement.

**Application in GitChain:**

- **Private Code Verification:** Developers can prove they have certain rights or knowledge without exposing the actual code.
- **Secure Collaboration:** Enables collaboration on proprietary projects while maintaining confidentiality.

**Example Use Case:**

- A company wants to verify that a contributor has not introduced vulnerabilities without revealing the proprietary code. ZKPs make this possible.

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

**Concept Overview:**

- FHE allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it first.
- The result, when decrypted, matches the result of operations performed on the plaintext.

**Application in GitChain:**

- **Encrypted Code Analysis:** Perform security checks or code analysis on encrypted codebases.
- **Compliance and Auditing:** Enables external auditors to verify compliance without accessing sensitive code.

**Metaphor:** It's like having a locked box where someone can rearrange the items inside without opening it, and when you unlock it, you see the changes made.

## Getting Started

**Note:** GitChain is currently in the MVP/POC stage.

1. **Download GitChain Node Software:**

   - Clone the GitChain repository (ironically hosted on GitHub for the MVP).
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gitchain.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the directory.
     ```bash
     cd gitchain
     ```

2. **Run the Node Software:**

   - Start your GitChain node.
     ```bash
     python gitchain.py
     ```
   - The node will generate your cryptographic keys and connect to the network.

3. **Configure Git:**

   - Set up Git to use the GitChain remote helper.
     ```bash
     git config --global url."gitchain://".insteadOf "git@github.com:"
     ```

4. **Cloning a Repository:**

   - Clone a repository from the GitChain network.
     ```bash
     git clone gitchain://repository_name
     ```

5. **Collaborating:**

   - Use standard Git commands to commit, push, and pull changes.
   - The GitChain node handles network communication and enforces permissions.
